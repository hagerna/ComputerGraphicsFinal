# ComputerGraphicsFinal
Final Project for Computer Graphics: Programming 3D Applications (DIS Copenhagen Spring 2022) Nick Hager and Julia Kispert 

### Here is more information about the class: https://disabroad.org/copenhagen/courses/computer-graphics/

Project allows a user to go through a different universe in space using keys on their keyboard. Turn up volume for a fun surpise!  

# How To Run: 
Open up repository in a code editor and use "go live" feature. 
**If using VS Code, "go live" will show up in bottom right corner. It will open a new browser and allow you to start running the program.

# Future Goals: 
- prevent users from going through planets
- add in different floating objects through space (not in orbit)
- change movement 
- allow users to choose the lightening the sun projects
